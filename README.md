# Book_Recommender_System
This model uses collaborative filtering where cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity scores to recommend similar books to a user.
## Dataset
Download the dataset from the given link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset and save it in a folder say Book Recommender System.

## Code
Open the jupyter notebook and follow the codes I uploaded in Untitled python file.
Basically you just include the books which are rated by more than 50 users and the users whose ratings you will take for similarity score are those who has atleast rated 250 books and this reduces the dataset along with that remove all the books with similar names but different ISBN. 
This was the basic idea behind the project else than this I have used bootstrap and html for the web development part.
